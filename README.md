# WarmBeforeBath
A programm for Arduino controllers that lets various users control the temperature of a 
division over a week through a scheduled reserve of the device.
This programm was developped within the context of the contest BitChallenge 2018 
promoted by Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico 
(http://bitchallenge.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/BitChallenge18_class1/index.html) in 
colaboration with Miguel Fazenda (miguel71).
It was the first programm I wrote outside college.
